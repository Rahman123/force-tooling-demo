# Force.com Tooling API Demo

This is a simple Spring MVC web application that implements a very simple Force.com code browser/editor. The demo allows developers to read, edit, and (soon) create and delete Apex classes.

## Getting Started

1. Setup your salesforce.com OAuth Remote Access. You will then have a OAuth client key and secret
2. Update the Environment variables to include the OAuth client key and secret
3. Navigate to the "classes" page and you should now be authenticated against salesforce and view/update classes
